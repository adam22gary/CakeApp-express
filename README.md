### CORE GOALS

## Tech Stack

### CORE STACKS: MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS

### EXPRESS

FOREVER: CLI tool for ensuring that a given script runs continuously.
NODEMON: a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
BCRYPTJS: hash passwords
CELEBRATE: celebrate is an express middleware function that wraps the joi validation library. This allows you to use this middleware in any single route, or globally, and ensure that all of your inputs are correct before any handler function.
CORS: a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
DOTENV: Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env
JSONWEBTOKEN: way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. ... Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties.
MAILGEN: A Node.js package that generates clean, responsive HTML e-mails for sending transactional mail.
MONGOOSE: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
MORGAN: HTTP request logger middleware for node.js
PASSPORT: Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js. Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.
PASSPORT-JWT: A Passport strategy for authenticating with a JSON Web Token. This module lets you authenticate endpoints using a JSON web token. It is intended to be used to secure RESTful endpoints without sessions.
PASSPORT-LOCAL: Passport strategy for authenticating with a username and password. This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.
PASSPORT-LOCAL-MONGOOSE: Passport-Local Mongoose is a Mongoose plugin that simplifies building username and password login with Passport.
VALIDATOR: A library of string validators and sanitizers.

### REACT

REACT-REDUX : binding React with Redux
REDUX : Tool for State Management. Reasons: a single store is used to keep the state of the app
REDUX-FORM: way to manage your form state in Redux.
REDUX-THUNK: Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.
ANT-DESIGN: design creation. Reasons: it provides components, resources and tools for process optimization.
JEST: Javascript Testing solution. Reasons: Tests are created by developers with snapshot is created automatically. If there are differences between tests (ie. snapshots), developers get notified the changes.
